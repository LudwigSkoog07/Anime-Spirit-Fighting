# AnimeFightingSpirit

## Quick change-tracking (LATEST_CHANGE)
A single-file change tracker is included to keep a record of the *most recent* change only. The file `LATEST_CHANGE.txt` is overwritten each time you record a change.

Helpers:
- `scripts/update_latest_change.lua` — overwrite `LATEST_CHANGE.txt` from a Lua runner (e.g., `lua scripts/update_latest_change.lua "Your message"`).
- `scripts/update_latest_change.ps1` — PowerShell helper (Windows): `.\scripts\update_latest_change.ps1 -Text "Your message"`.

Reason: you asked for a text file that is overwritten each time you write a change so you can "keep up" with the latest change.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "AnimeFightingSpirit.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `AnimeFightingSpirit.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

For more help, check out [the Rojo documentation](https://rojo.space/docs).

Recommended workflow to avoid Studio/old-code confusion:

1. Run a fresh build to generate a place that matches your VS Code sources:

```bash
rojo build -o built.rbxl
```

2. Open `built.rbxl` in Roblox Studio (File → Open) — this guarantees Studio uses the latest code.

3. Alternatively, use `rojo serve` and then restart the Studio Play session after the server reports a successful sync.

4. If you see errors like `shared is not a valid member of PlayerScripts` or infinite yields on `Remotes`, run the sync checker:

```lua
-- In Studio command bar or run as a script:
local checker = require("scripts/check_sync")
checker.Run()
```

This will warn about missing `ReplicatedStorage.Shared`, `ReplicatedStorage.Remotes`, or `Server.services.RemotesInit`.
